Returning NULL is the same as returning void.

A token cannot contain a space unless it is a string literal.



A sourceunit is a block of code that can be executed in isolation or as a function call from another execution.
A Ralyu state keeps track of all sourceunits
A function has a pointer to a sourceunit.

There are two types of sourceunits
GLOBAL and FUNCTION

Global sourceunits store all their variable and function declarations in the state as globals.
Function sourceunits store their variable and function declarations locally and are discarded when the sourceunit exits.
Function sourceunits can also have arguments and a return value that can be used by both Ralyu and C.

To run code, you first load a sourceunit and then you run it.
Loading it only turns the source code into statements and tokens by the lexer which can be executed.
You should not load the same source code twice.

Running sourceunits executes its statements.



example source unit ":

int a = 0
a += 10
print(a)

function add(int a, int b)
	return a + b
end

int b = add(a, a)
print(b)

*end of file*

When this piece of code is read, it will generate two sourceunits and two global variables in the state



Calling Ralyu code from C:

The base function for calling code is:
Ral_Object* Ral_CallFunction(Ral_State* state, Ral_Function* function, Ral_List* arguments)
